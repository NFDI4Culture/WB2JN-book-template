# Fields needed for WB2JN

We need to test out the below and see what the results would look like on a number of Ensembles. The test can just be a checklist check and see if the attributes or texts exist and have data needed. After this we can do other tests. We shsould check 9 example Ensembles.

  1. Solitude
  2. Bad Pyrmont, Schloss Pyrmont - https://www.deckenmalerei.eu/b462cec2-5ade-45da-be2e-759323274a52 
  3. etc 

These are all the things for which are needed as 'things' that then would each have a group of attributes. My thinking is that if we have these things and their 'has part' or 'is part of' attribute in the tree, then this allows to select them from a tree and say which things and thing attributes we want to use.

The 'has part' or 'is part of' tree links are not listed here.

  - Castle / Palace (Ensemble)
  - Photo
  - Building
  - Building part
  - Text part
  - Room
  - Painting
  - Image cycle (Bildzyklus) (because these are another way that paintings have been marked up and are not marked up as being paintings. We don't have to include them if its a problem)
